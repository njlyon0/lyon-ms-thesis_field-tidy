# Lyon MS Thesis - Field Data Tidying

Wrangling of all field-collected data collected for my MS thesis. This spans multiple projects conducted at different subsets of the sites in the Grand River Grasslands (GRG). Descriptions of these are included below.

## Script Explanations

- `bee-project_tidy-bees.R` - Tidying bee data from 2017 & 2018 collected as part of a 'bee project' focused on the sensitivity of native bee communities to management practices
- `bee-project_tidy-flowers.R` - Tidying floral resource (i.e., nectar-producing plant) data from the same years as the related native bee dataset
- `daubenmire-project_tidy-plants.R` - Tidying of plant data collected in 2.5 x 0.5 meter "Daubenmire" quadrats

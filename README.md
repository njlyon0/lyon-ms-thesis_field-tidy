# Lyon MS Thesis - Field Data Tidying

Wrangling of all field-collected data collected for my MS thesis. This spans multiple projects conducted at different subsets of the sites in the Grand River Grasslands (GRG). Descriptions of these are included below.

## Sub-Project Descriptions

Experimental design: each site is divided into three equal patches, some treatments are applied to patch level and others are applied to site level

- "Butterfly Project" -- How are butterflies and flowering plants influenced by various combinations of fire and cattle grazing?
    - Annual data (20**07** - 2018) collected between May and August
    - Butterfly surveys and nectar-producing plant surveys conducted

- "Bee Project" -- How narrow of a spatial scale are bees affected by the fire/grazing treatments? Is there separation of the community composition based on foraging height?
    - Annual data (20**17** - 2018) collected between May and July
    - Bee traps ("bowls") placed on fence posts at either 1m from ground or 2-5cm from ground, nectar-producing plants also surveyed within 1m radius circle of each fence post

- "Daubenmire Project" -- How do plant functional groups respond to fire/grazing combinations?
   - Intensive sampling of plant functional group percent cover inside of quadrats in July annually (20**07** - 2018)
   - Also measured litter depth (cm) and Robel pole visual obstruction (decimeters)
